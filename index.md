We study mechanisms of estrogen regulated gene expression in cell culture models using routine cell/molecular biology and genomics approaches. Genes of interest include GPER, CSTA, HOXB2, MMP-11 and CYP1A1. The idea is to understand how regulation of these genes by estrogen is connected to breast cancer initiation and progression. Our investigations into biological properties of bioactive compounds have motivated us to study the apparent estrogen receptor modulatory activity of karanjin, and enterolactone.

## What's new from molendolab
Our latest paper on the estrogen regulation of the G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in breast cancer cell lines is out. This work was a collaboration between Molecular Endocrinology Lab (IIT Guwahati), NIRRH (Mumbai), NEIGRIHMS (Shillon), and Dr. Bhubaneswar Borooah Cancer Institute (Guwahati).

## Recent achievements
**Karanjin** has partial estrogen like effects. This was a transcriptomics study that recently go published in Gene. The paper highlights the enrichment of G2/M checkpoint and estrogen-response-early genes in karanjin modulated gene repertoire in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Here is the [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111922003262) to the paper on the journal site.
