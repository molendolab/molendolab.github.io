Our research group seeks to understand estrogen signaling, and its effects on gene expression. The role and relevance of canonical and non-canonical estrogen receptors, and their gene targets in the development and progression of breast tumors, is of interest to us. We use routine cell and molecular biology approaches to answer specific questions related to mechanisms of estrogen-regulated gene expression.The long term goal is to identify useful biomarkers, or gene expression patterns that will assist in devising therapeutic strategies. We also study phytochemicals for their potential as estrogen receptor modulators.

## What's new from molendolab
Check out our recent online pre-print in [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/about-biorxiv). We present data to show that karanjin, a furanoflavoniod from Pongammia pinnata, affects gene expression in beast cancer cells in a manner that partly resembles estrogen.
