We study mechanisms of estrogen regulated gene expression in cell culture models using routine cell/molecular biology and genomics approaches. Genes of interest include GPER, CSTA, HOXB2, MMP-11 and CYP1A1. The idea is to understand how regulation of these genes by estrogen is connected to breast cancer initiation and progression. Our investigations into biological properties of bioactive compounds have motivated us to study the apparent estrogen receptor modulatory activity of karanjin, and enterolactone.

## What's new from molendolab
Enterolactone is a mammalian enterolignan that is produced by the gut microbes. Our recent article in the Journal of Agriculture and Food Research shows how enerolactone differentially impacts CYP1A1 mRNA and protein expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, thereby providing interesting insights into the protective effect of enterolactone against breast cancer; particularly in post-menopausal women. The regulation of CYP1A1 mRNA is particularly interesting. Our results show that enterolactone, like estrogen, interferes with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-dependent expression of CYP1A1 mRNA.

## Recent achievements
**Karanjin** has partial estrogen like effects. This was a transcriptomics study that recently go published in Gene. The paper highlights the enrichment of G2/M checkpoint and estrogen-response-early genes in karanjin modulated gene repertoire in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Here is the [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111922003262) to the paper on the journal site.
