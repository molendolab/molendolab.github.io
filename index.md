Our research group seeks to understand estrogen signaling, and its effects on gene expression. The role and relevance of canonical and non-canonical estrogen receptors, and their gene targets in the development and progression of breast tumors, is of interest to us. We use routine cell and molecular biology approaches to answer specific questions related to mechanisms of estrogen-regulated gene expression.The long term goal is to identify useful biomarkers, or gene expression patterns that will assist in devising therapeutic strategies. We also study phytochemicals for their potential as estrogen receptor modulators.

## What's new from molendolab
Our RNA-seq data on MCF-7 cells treated with the GPER agonist, G1 is now submitted in Gene Expression Omnibus [GSE188706] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE188706). The data description article can be accessed with this [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340922001597)
