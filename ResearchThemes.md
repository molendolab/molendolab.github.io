## Non-genomic estrogen signaling

### The G-protein coupled estrogen receptor

<p align="justify">
Besides inducing genomic effects via the classical estrogen receptors ER-alpha and ER-beta, estrogen induces short-term non-genomic effects via GPER. GPER activation induces cell type or context dependent effects; cell proliferation or cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Aberrant expression implicates this receptor in endocrine cancers. It is projected as a tumor suppressor, whose expression correlates with prognosis. Clinical data, and results from in vitro studies implicate this receptor in endocrine resistance.

Our research focusses on the mechanisms of GPER regulation. Our finding, that DNA methylation in the upstream CpG island correlates with GPER expression in breast tumors, and breast cancer cell lines, is published ([Manjegowda et al, 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28286086/)). Our's is not the only laboratory to demonstrate this. However, one of the highlights of our work is the finding that eight terminal CpG dinucleotides in the downstream end of the island may play a major role in DNA methylation dependent silencing of GPER in breast cancer cells.

There are two other articles published from our laboratory on methylation in the upstream CpG island. Interestingly, these papers deal with methylation and GPER expression in the context of colon cancer cells. Follow the links below to access these articles.
